# Introduction

Implementation of the project from the book -
[Zero To Production In Rust](https://zero2prod.com): an opinionated introduction to backend development using Rust.

It's a great resource if you want to learn
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and the [Actix-web](https://actix.rs/)
framework by implementing a real-world production ready app.
